    "# Geospatial Analytics Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geospatial Analytics component provides an API (at https://api.ibm.com/geospatial/run/na/). To use this you will also need an API key, a Tenant (or Client) Id and an Org Id. If you don’t have an API key, a Tenant (or Client) Id and an Org Id please contact your IBM representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter Notebooks that are part of this quick start tutorial we don’t include secret credentials. We read the credentials from operating system environment variables when they are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "EIS_ORG_ID    = os.environ.get('EIS_ORG_ID')\n",
    "EIS_TENANT_ID = os.environ.get('EIS_TENANT_ID')\n",
    "EIS_API_KEY   = os.environ.get('EIS_API_KEY')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "If you do not have a tenant id you can instead set a client id (e.g. EIS_CLIENT_ID) and pass client_id = EIS_CLIENT_ID to the authentication.OAuth2 object init or the get_client() call.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Set these values in your environment before you start so that they are ready to be used when required, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Linux\n",
    "In the shell where you will launch the Jupyter notebooks do the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export EIS_ORG_ID    = <your IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite org id here>\n",
    "export EIS_TENANT_ID = <your IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite tenant key here>\n",
    "export EIS_API_KEY   = <your IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite api key key here>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can now start to use the notebooks provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Windows\n",
    "Open the 'Environment Variables' dialog by doing the following\n",
    "\n",
    " * Type 'sysdm.cpl' into the 'Type here to search' box to bring up the 'System Properties' dialog\n",
    " * Select the 'Advanced' tab\n",
    " * Press the 'Environment Variables...' button\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 'Environment Variables' dialog you can create 'New...' environment variables for EIS_API_KEY, EIS_TENANT_ID and EIS_ORG_ID setting the values to the ones you have been given. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have set environment variables you need to start a new DOS prompt or Powershell. The new shells will adopt these new environment variables. From here, you can now start to use the notebooks provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python3 \n",
    "\n",
    "The API tutorials are written in Python3. You can use any programming language by talking to the Geospatial Analytics HTTP endpoints using the standard HTTP libraries from your language of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Python3 but don't have an environment set up including Jupyter notebooks there are many resources on the internet that can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PAIRS Python API Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks in this tutorial use the [ibmpairs](https://github.com/IBM/ibmpairs) API wrapper for convenience. You will need to install this into your Python3 environment. Make sure you have install at least version 3.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more detailed overview of the IBM PAIRS Python API Wrapper [here](tutorial/pythonapiwrapper.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIP \n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install ibmpairs>=3.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Auth token\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done with the setup, you'll have to make a call to ibmpairs' client module, by passing in your 'EIS_ORG_ID', 'EIS_TENANT_ID', 'EIS_API_KEY'. You'll have to specify the version of Geospatial Analytics that you want to get the client from (can be 3 or 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import configparser\n",
    "\n",
    "config = configparser.RawConfigParser()\n",
    "config.read('../../auth/secrets.ini')\n",
    "\n",
    "EIS_ORG_ID     = config.get('EIS', 'api.org_id') \n",
    "EIS_TENANT_ID  = config.get('EIS', 'api.tenant_id') \n",
    "EIS_API_KEY     = config.get('EIS', 'api.key')\n",
    "\n",
    "EIS_client_v4 = client.get_client(org_id    = EIS_ORG_ID,\n",
    "                                  tenant_id = EIS_TENANT_ID,\n",
    "                                  api_key   = EIS_API_KEY,\n",
    "                                  version   = 4\n",
    "                                )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an activity the you need to perform before querying anything from the Geospatial Analytics but this is a one time activity for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see a detailed implementation or usage of the Authentication client in the other notebooks moving forward."
